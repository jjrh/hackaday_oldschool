* Description
  I like many others weren't really happy with the new redesign of the 
  hackaday.com website.

  While this isn't doing much other than being a RSS reader, almost the 
  entire site is accessable with RSS. Making it rather simple to parse that
  and create a website with any layout one wishes.

* install instructions
  Should just be:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ npm install  
  #+END_SRC

  then run with either 
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./run.sh
  #+END_SRC
  OR
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ bin/www
  #+END_SRC

*** Stuff TODO
**** TODO Cache feeds either in memory or a database (or both)
**** TODO Improve on the template to include some of the hackaday logos and links.
**** TODO Pullin the old hackaday html page to provide a true classic view.
**** TODO figure out if we can use black and white images like the really old school site.
